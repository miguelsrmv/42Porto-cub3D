# 42Porto-cub3D
Project developed during the Common Core @ 42 Porto

## cub3D
My first RayCaster with miniLibX

### Summary:
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
